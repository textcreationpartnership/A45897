            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THis Decree which is now ſo much tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of it <hi>France,</hi> being ſent over to me, I thought it would not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful to this Nation to have it reprinted here with an Engliſh Tranſlation; but leſt ſome unwary Readers might make an ill uſe of it, I judged it needful to prepare them to it by two Reflections, which from the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Decree they ought to make.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, That thoſe monſtrous Tenets for which we have ſo often heard the Caſuiſts of the Roman Church, particularly the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, accuſed, are no falſe Imputations un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly laid to their Charge, but are truly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by them. This none can have a face to deny any more, ſince the Pope and a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of Cardinals have gathered theſe
<pb facs="tcp:94678:3"/>Opinions out of the Books of Caſuiſts, and have thus condemned them. So that our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines who have charged that Church for tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerating theſe impious and immoral Doctrines, are no more to be ſuſpected as falſe Accuſers, ſince here we have Witneſſes beyond excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that theſe Opinions have been publickly taught by the Maſters of the Caſuiſtical Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity among them.</p>
            <p>Of the following Propoſitions <hi>I</hi> deſire the Reader may conſider the 26. and 27. by which he will ſee that thoſe Directors of Conſciences, teach, <hi>That if a man is queſtioned whether he has done a thing that he really did, he may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwear it, meaning within himſelf ſome other thing, or any other way of doing it, or any additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to what he ſays, in which caſes he does not lie, nor is he perjured: And a juſt cauſe of ſuch Reſervation, is, when they are neceſſary to ſave our Life, Honour, or Goods, or for any other act of vertue; ſo that the concealment of truth be judged expedient or deſirable.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:94678:3"/>
            <p>By this Doctrin, ſuppoſe a man is examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed concerning the Murder of Sir <hi>Edmund-Bury Godfrey,</hi> that was privy to it, he may ſwear he knows nothing of it, meaning either that he was not unjuſtly murdered, or that he was not murdered with an ill intention, or that he knows nothing of it ſo as to tell thoſe who examin him: and there is a very juſt cauſe for uſing theſe Reſervations, ſince ſuch denials are intended to preſerve the Lives, Honour, and Goods of Catholicks. Theſe being the Opinions of their Doctors, none can wonder if the People, a great part of whoſe Devotion it is to obey their Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, are perſwaded into ſuch practices.</p>
            <p>But to this it may be now oppoſed, that theſe Opinions being condemned by the Pope, we need fear the ill effects of them no more. Upon this <hi>I</hi> ſhall make a ſecond Reflection, which is no leſs clear than the former; that this Condemnation is ſo lame and defective, that notwithſtanding it, even thoſe who ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb facs="tcp:94678:4"/>to the Infallibility of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> may ſtill hold the following Poſitions. <hi>I</hi> need not deſire the Reader to obſerve that it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove twenty years ſince Complaints were firſt made to the Popes by ſome of their own Clergie in <hi>France,</hi> of the Immoral and Impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Doctrines of the Caſuiſts: but ſo preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent were the Arts, that the Juſuits have uſed to obſtruct any Cenſure, that the world has been all this while corrupted with theſe ill Opinions, which many Confeſſors have infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed into peoples conſciences; whereby it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be doubted but many thouſand ſouls have been loſt: and this Sentence which has been but a week in <hi>England,</hi> comes too late for them, who are already in another world, and are anſwering for the prevarications to which they may have been perſwaded by their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors.</p>
            <p>But after all this Condemnation, we are not at all ſecured from the ill effects of theſe Opinions. For the Pope does not condemn
<pb facs="tcp:94678:4"/>them as Impious, Immoral, or contrary to the Laws of God and Nature: Now does he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire all perſons under the pain of mortal ſin, or as they would not incur the indignation of Almighty God, to teach theſe Propoſitions no more; though that is the common ſtyle of Bulls, in matters of much leſs concernment. If he had done it thus, the Condemnation had been of greater Authority; and ſo all that believe the Pope infallible had been indeed obiligatory, and indiſpenſable. But it is of a far milder ſtrain: theſe Opinions are declared to be at leaſt<note n="*" place="margin">See the like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark made on the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that Pope <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander</hi> the 7th paſſed on ſome other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, by D. <hi>Lloyd</hi> in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon at the Funeral of Sir <hi>Edmund Bury God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey,</hi> p. 32.33.</note> 
               <hi>ſcandalous</hi> and <hi>pernicious in practice.</hi> How ſoftly and mercifully does his Holineſs treat them. To be Scandalous and Pernicious amounts to no more, but that ſuch Propoſitions have ill effects, but does not conclude them to be ill in themſelves. If then the caſe comes, that theſe Opinions may have good effects, the Pope by a faculty may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence with them, ſince they are not declared to be in themſelves evil or impious.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:94678:5"/>
            <p>All perſons are alſo required neither to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend nor publiſh them, nor reduce them to practice: This is only a Prohibition, but no Condemnation. The Pains are, Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> and they are required in the vertue of <hi>Holy Obedience</hi> to do ſo no more. Nothing here of the Law of God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but only <hi>Holy Obedience:</hi> Therefore ſince the Pope can diſpence with all the Laws of the Church, but more particularly with the Obedience due to himſelf, it is evident from hence that all the effect this Decree can have, is only to make it neceſſary for Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors to procure a Faculty diſpenſing with it, before they may poſſeſs their Penitents with theſe Opinions: which, how eaſily it may be obtained at <hi>Rome,</hi> is well enough known.</p>
            <p>So that by this Decree theſe two Points are clearly made out, that ſuch Opinions are maintained by many Caſuiſts in the Roman Communion; and that this notwithſtanding they may be ſtill taught among them.</p>
